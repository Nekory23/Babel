# Babel
{EPITECH} | Third year | Advanced C++

The project consists in a client/server architecture voice over IP application, similar to Skype or TeamSpeak.

The Babel project aims to create an SIP-like Voice Over IP (VOIP) protocol. It MUST be usable over the Internet (no multicast or anything LAN specific).

To test your protocol you MUST write a server and a client implementation.
The protocol MUST be a client/server protocol but voice transport MUST be client to client (the server can have a proxy mode for conference calls or NAT-ed clients).

See the subject for further details !
